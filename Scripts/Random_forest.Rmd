```{r random_forest_classification}
# Machine or ensemble learning method. Can do both regression and classification tasks, and undertakes dimensional reduction methods, treats missing values, outlier values and other essential steps of data exploration. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where multiple CART models are combined

# Set a random seed so that results are reproducible next time we load the code - because this process has two sources of randomness (bagging for bootstrap aggregating takes subset of rows and only running subset of samples each time and subset of predictor variables (sqrt of those available))

set.seed(3693)

fit1 <- randomForest(as.factor(sampled_points$SOAP_ID) ~ .,
                      data=sampled_points, 
                      importance=TRUE, 
                      ntree=5000)
# ntree is number of trees to grow

# What variables were important?
varImpPlot(fit1)



```

# Fin!
